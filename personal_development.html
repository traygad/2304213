    <h1>My Personal Development Page</h1>
    <p>This page will contain my reflections on personal growth and life lessons.</p>

<h2>Personal Growth</h2>
    <p>Through my time in university, I’ve learned the importance of time management and dedication. I’ve developed strong technical skills, especially in web development and IT related problems.</p>

    <h2>Future Goals</h2>
 <p>In the future, I aim to continue building my skills as a developer and work on large-scale web projects that impact users positively.</p>

<h2>Reflection on "Twelve Pillars" (Chapters 4-7)</h2>
    <p>The writers of *Twelve Pillars* address the value of connections, leadership, and personal development in Chapters 4–7. The importance of surrounding oneself with the proper people who challenge and encourage you is one of the most important lessons I learned from these chapters. I want to use this in my life, especially as I pursue my academic and professional goals..</p>

    <p>Another significant lesson is that success is not just about personal achievement but also about helping others grow. This idea resonates with me, and I intend to incorporate it into my future career as a web developer, where collaboration and teamwork will be key to success.</p>

    
    <h2>My Degree</h2>
    <p>I am currently pursuing a Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science at the University of Technology.</p>

    <h2>Skills I've Acquired</h2>
    <p>During my studies, I have gained strong skills in <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>, which allow me to create clean, user-friendly web pages. These skills form the foundation for my future growth as a web developer.</p>
